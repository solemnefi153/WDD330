        <h1>Week 2 Notes</h1> 
        <h2>Syntax</h2>
        <p>
            JavaScript does not require semicolon. JavaScript interpreters uses Automatic Semicolon Insertion, 
            which inserts a semicolon for you. Also, our code does not need to be written in different lines. 
            It can all be written in one line. However, it is best practice to write every code statement in a 
            different line with a semicolon to avoid compiling errors that might occur and for readability. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Blocks do not need a semicolon. 
        </p>
        <h2>Variable Declaration</h2>
        <p>
            ES6 states that it is best practice to use let and const when declaring variables
        </p>
        <p>
            When creating a const variable the variable becomes immutable, if the datatype is a primitive 
            datatype. Otherwise the data inside the variable or object can be mutable, but the datatype of 
            the variable cannot be changed. 
        </p>
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>
            Let and const have block scope. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Var has global scope.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is best practice to use variables with local scope to avoid overwriting data unintentionally  
            that has global scope. We should keep at minimum our global variables to avoid this issue. 
        </p>
        <h2>Direct assignment and Assignment by reference</h2>
        <p>
            When you assign a primitive type variable to another variable, the value is copied over.  
            Each variable value is independent of the other.  
        </p>
        <p>
            When you assign a non-primitive type variable to another non-primitive type variable a reference  
            to the other variableâ€™s value is passed. Any changes made to any of these variables will change  
            the same value that both variables are referencing.
        </p>
        <h1>Symbols </h1>
        <p>
            Symbols are a new primitive data type introduced in ES6. Their main purpose is to create unique keys  
            for objects. For example, if you are using, you are not sure of the keys of be object and need to add 
            a key value pair, you can create a symbol to represent the key. That way the values of the object do  
            not overwrite. 
        </p>
        <h1>Memory Leaks</h1>
        <p>
            Most modern programming language, including JavaScript, employ various dynamic memory management   
            techniques such as garbage collection, which is the process of automatically removing items from 
            memory that are no longer required by the program. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Sets that use primitive data use garbage collection. When non primitive objects are stored in a set, 
            memory leaks can happen. WeakSet() solves that problem by clearing the memory of any object whose 
            the last reference to the object has been deleted. WeakMap() do the same thing. 
        </p>
