        <h1>Week 5 Notes</h1>
        <p> 
            When we write code in a development environment, we should write it in a way that when it fails, 
            we can quickly identify that there is a bug. (Design the program so that if it fails, it fails loudly).  
            In a production environment, issues should fail gracefully. 
        </p> 
        <h2>Strict Mode</h2>
        <pre>
            <code>
    'use strict';
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            We can put this link of code at the top of our JavaScript file so when the code is running, it will 
            through errors for poorly styled code. This will increase errors but will help us ensure that the 
            code is well written and thus avoids big hidden bugs.
        </p>
        <h2>Linting Tools</h2>
        <p> 
            Are pronging’s that can be installed and help check that the code is following certain coding 
            conventions. 
        </p>
        <h2>Exception Handling</h2>
        <h3>Try</h3>
        <p>
            We can use try to wrap code that might through an exception and that we do not want that exception 
            to crash the application. 
        </p>
        <h3>Catch</h3>
        <p>
            “catch” is the “else” statement of “try”, if we think of “try” as the “if” statement. When we use 
            “try” we are saying, if this code works then continue the program, else throw an exception.  
            The exception that is thrown is caught by a catch statement. 
        </p>
        <h1>Test</h1>
        <p>
            A test is a function that checks if a piece of code is working in the way it should. 
        </p>
        <h2>Test-driven Development</h2>
        <p>
            Is the process of writing test before writing the actual code.  The life cycle of test-driven 
            development is: 
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Write tests (that initially fail)</li>
            <li>Write code to pass the tests </li>
            <li>Refactor the code </li>
            <li>Test refactored code </li>
            <li>Write more tests for new features </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Testing Frameworks</h2>
        <p>Jest is a popular testing framework developed by Facebook. It can be installed in in the computer using npm</p>

        <pre>
            <code>
    //Example: 

    function squareRoot(number) { 
        'use strict'; 
        if (number &lt; 0) { 
            throw new RangeError(&quot;You can't find the square root of negative numbers&quot;) 
        } 
        return Math.sqrt(number); 
    }; 

    test('square root of 4 is 2', () =&gt; { 
        expect(squareRoot(4)).toBe(2); 
    });
            </code>
        </pre>
