        <h2> Client-side validation </h2>
        <h3>What is client-side validation? </h3>
        <p>
            Client-side validation uses the client (Browser) to check the date that has been entered in a 
            form before the form is submitted. 
        </p>
        <p>
            One advantage of the client-side validation is that it gives immediate feedback to the user 
            about the validation of the data provided. Without client-side validation the data provided in 
            the form could be sent with errors.
        </p>
        <p>
            The two main problems with sending invalid data to the server is that if there is no server-side
             validation, the data might cause errors in the server or it could result with unwanted behavior. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Even if there is strong implementation of server-side validation, if the data sent to the server 
            is invalid, it would take some time to send a response to the user, letting him/her know that the 
            data was invalid. This delay affects the user experience and discourages users form staying in the 
            website. 
        </p>
        <h3>Types of client-side validation</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Built in form validation: </b>Uses HTML5 features to perform validation. It is more efficient that 
            JavaScript validation but less customizable. One great advantage of using built in validation is that 
            it automatically checks the input and updates its state (valid / invalid). Then in our CSS we can create
             a class for valid: invalid input fields that will update the UI base on the state of the input fields. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>JavaScript validation:</b> The validation is performed using JavaScript. The advantage is that is 
            very customizable, but you need to white the whole code to perform the validation. To use CSS classes 
            for valid / invalid input fields, we have to manually set the state of the input through JavaScript after 
            the validation is performed. 
        </p>
        <h3> Validating forms using JavaScript </h3>
        <p>
            One way that I use to approach front end validation is with the use of functions that search the DOM
             and then grabs the value and evaluates if the input is valid or not. JavaScript has a constraint 
             validation API which is a fancy way of saying that we can use JavaScript to find elements in the DOM
              and then call some methods available for those elements to check if the input is valid, based on the
               validation required and defined in the elements through the HTML. 
        </p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
    On the HTML File 
    &#x3C;form&#x3E;
        &#x3C;label for=&#x22;mail&#x22;&#x3E;I would like you to provide me with an e-mail address:&#x3C;/label&#x3E;
        &#x3C;input type=&#x22;email&#x22; id=&#x22;mail&#x22; name=&#x22;mail&#x22;&#x3E;
        &#x3C;button&#x3E;Submit&#x3C;/button&#x3E;
    &#x3C;/form&#x3E;
    
    
    On the JavaScript File 
    
    const email = document.getElementById(&#x22;mail&#x22;);
    
    email.addEventListener(&#x22;input&#x22;, function (event) {
        if (email.validity.typeMismatch) {
        email.setCustomValidity(&#x22;I am expecting an e-mail address!&#x22;);
        } else {
        email.setCustomValidity(&#x22;&#x22;);
        }
    });
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            I did not know that, so I will start using them more often on my front-end validation.
        </p>
        <h2>Using Fetch</h2>
        <h3>The Fetch API </h3>
        <p>
            It provides an interface to make HTTP requests. It provides a global function fetch (). 
            This fetch function received a URL address as a parameter and some other optional parameters 
            to define the request type, headers, body of the request, etc. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This is how I have used fetch() in previous projects
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
    // Search for the venues in Foursquare
    const getVenues = async () =&#x3E; {
        const city = city_input.val();
        const category = category_input.val();
        //We need the this to make an call to a Proxy api that uses private keys
        const baseHref = window.location.href
        const urlToFetch = &#x60;${baseHref}findPlaces?city=${city}&#x26;category=${category}&#x60;
        const response = await fetch(urlToFetch);
        const jsonResponse = await response.json();
        if (response.ok) {
            const venues = jsonResponse.response.groups[0].items.map(item =&#x3E; item.venue);
            const center = jsonResponse.response.geocode.center
            //Return all the venues and an array with the coordinates of the city 
            return {venues: venues, center: [center.lat, center.lng]};
        }
        else{
            throw jsonResponse;
        }
    } 
            </code>
